# Smart-Sewage-Monitaring-System-using-IOT

## This system helps in monitoring sewage level through ultrasonic sensor and monitoring flow rate through flow sensor and receiving notification on sewage level reaching its threshold value, therefore helping sewage workers to take decisions for cleanliness and also maintain a healthy and disease free environment.

## It can be implemented as a smart device that can sense when the drainage system gets blocked and if the water overflows because of this blockage, we will send a notification to the municipal authority for the necessary action.Moreover, using the Android well as cloud applications, the status of the drainage system can be monitored in real-time.
